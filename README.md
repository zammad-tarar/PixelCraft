## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

During this project, I enhanced my understanding of CSS Grid and how to structure a bento-style layout efficiently. Below is an example of how I used CSS Grid:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
  gap: 20px;
}
```

### Continued Development

In future projects, I aim to explore:

- More advanced animations with CSS and JavaScript.
- Enhancing accessibility features for better usability.

### Useful Resources

- [CSS Grid Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - A great resource for mastering CSS Grid.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - My go-to reference for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
